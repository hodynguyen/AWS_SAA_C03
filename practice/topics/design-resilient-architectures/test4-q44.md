**Why other options are incorrect:**

- The option that says: Amazon EC2 is incorrect since this is a compute service, not a storage service.

- The option that says: Amazon Elastic Block Storage is incorrect since EBS is primarily used as a storage of your EC2 instances.

- The option that says: Amazon SQS is incorrect since this is a message queuing service and does not extend your on-premises storage capacity.
