# Question 9

A Solutions Architect of a multinational gaming company develops video games for PS4, Xbox One, and Nintendo Switch consoles, plus a number of mobile games for Android and iOS. Due to the wide range of their products and services, the architect proposed that they use API Gateway.

What are the key features of API Gateway that the architect can tell to the client? (Select TWO.)

## Options

A. It automatically provides a query language for your APIs similar to GraphQL.

B. Enables you to run applications requiring high levels of inter-node communications at scale on AWS through its custom-built operating system (OS) bypass hardware interface.

C. Enables you to build RESTful APIs and WebSocket APIs that are optimized for serverless workloads.

D. Provides you with static anycast IP addresses that serve as a fixed entry point to your applications hosted in one or more AWS Regions.

E. You pay only for the API calls you receive and the amount of data transferred out.

## Correct Answers

**C. Enables you to build RESTful APIs and WebSocket APIs that are optimized for serverless workloads.**

**E. You pay only for the API calls you receive and the amount of data transferred out.**

## Explanation

Amazon API Gateway is a fully managed service that makes it easy for developers to create, publish, maintain, monitor, and secure APIs at any scale. It can use AWS Lambda, so you can run your APIs without servers.

Key features:
- Build RESTful APIs and WebSocket APIs
- Pay only for API calls and data transferred

### Why other options are incorrect:

- **A** - API Gateway doesn't provide GraphQL query language.

- **D** - This is AWS Global Accelerator, not API Gateway.

- **B** - This is Elastic Fabric Adapter, not API Gateway.
