# Question 58

A company needs to process large volumes of video files. The processing is CPU-intensive and takes several hours per file. The company wants to optimize costs while maintaining consistent throughput.

Which EC2 instance type is most suitable?

## Options

A. General purpose (M5) instances.

B. Compute optimized (C5) instances.

C. Memory optimized (R5) instances.

D. Storage optimized (I3) instances.

## Correct Answer

**B. Compute optimized (C5) instances.**

## Explanation

Compute optimized instances are ideal for compute-intensive workloads like video encoding, batch processing, and high-performance computing. C5 instances provide high-performance processors.

### Why other options are incorrect:

- **A** - M5 is general purpose, not optimized for compute.

- **C** - R5 is for memory-intensive workloads.

- **D** - I3 is for storage-intensive workloads.
